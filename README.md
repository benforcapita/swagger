# Video Editor

This project is a single-page video editing interface developed using Angular. It allows users to choose, arrange, and trim different video scenes on a track to create a virtual representation of a full video.

## General Requirements

1. The user will see a list of possible scenes.
2. The user will be able to preview each of the scenes.
3. The user will be able to drag-drop scenes to the timeline.
4. The user will be able to use the same scene several times.

## Track

1. There will be a ruler on top of the track, with a marker on every round second.
2. The user can rearrange the scenes on the track.
3. Each scene's length on the track will be proportional to the ruler.
4. The user will be able to zoom in and out on the X-axis.
5. The user will be able to play the track from the beginning, one scene after the other.
6. The user can pause the preview by clicking the 'Pause' button.

## Extras

1. The cursor will move to the location of a click on the track (X-axis only).
2. The video can be played from where the cursor is.
3. The cursor will move to the current time playing when the video is played.
4. Clicking to move the cursor while playing the video will update its location and continue playing from that point.

## Assumptions

- There is no need for space between scenes on the track.
- There are no real layers, only a single track.
